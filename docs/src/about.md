## Contributing

If you like this package, consider contributing! You can send bug reports (or fix them
and send your code), add examples to the documentation or propose new features.

Below we detail some of the guidelines that should be followed when contributing
to this package.

### Branches

Each pull request (PR) should be pushed in a new branch with the name of the author
followed by a descriptive name, e.g. `mforets/my_feature`. If the branch is
associated to a previous discussion in one issue, we use the name of the issue for easier
lookup, e.g. `mforets/7`.

### Unit testing and continuous integration (CI)

This project is synchronized with Travis CI, such that each PR gets tested
before merging (and the build is automatically triggered after each new commit).

For the maintainability of this project, we try to understand and fix the failing
doctests if they exist. We develop in Julia v1.0, but for experimentation
we also build on the nightly branch.

To run the unit tests locally, you should do:

```julia
$ julia --color=yes test/runtests.jl
```

### Contributing to the documentation

This documentation is written in Markdown, and it relies on
[Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) to produce the HTML
layout. To build the docs, run `make.jl`:

```julia
$ julia --color=yes docs/make.jl
```
